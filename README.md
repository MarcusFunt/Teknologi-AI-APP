# Modern Calendar

A minimalist yet expressive calendar experience built with React and Vite. Navigate between months, jump back to today, and scan upcoming highlights with a clean, glassy interface.

## Getting started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then visit the printed local URL (usually `http://localhost:5173`).

## Scripts
- `npm run dev` — start the Vite dev server
- `npm run build` — create a production build in `dist/`
- `npm run preview` — preview the production build locally
- `npm run lint` — run ESLint with the included modern defaults

## Notes
- Events are seeded from `sampleEvents` in `src/App.jsx` for the demo view.
- Styling lives in `src/index.css`; typography uses the Inter font.
